Common mistakes:

Add test cases for the program in the form of comments or a file.
The file pushed is a text file while a java file was expected.


Review for 1st program:

There is no readability in the code. Use valid naming conventions and comment lines so that it is easy to understand.
Line no. 24: 'm' can be declared and initialized in the for loop itself like you did for the variables 'l','m'.


Review for 2nd program:

No readability.


Review for 4th program:

Static keyword for a variable or a function should be avoided.
Try solving the program without using pre-defined functions such as Math.min()
